# Dictionary App

This project was created using React and some custom Javascript. Some Bootstrap elements were used as well as CSS media queries to create a responsive application.

This application handles multiple API queries to three sources - Google Dictionary API, DataMuse Rhymes API and Pexels image API, and manages them using React states.
